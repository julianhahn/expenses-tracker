# expenses-tracker

## Idea
This Repo should function as a Mono Repo, for a private tool.
There should be a folder with the code and Dockerfile for a frontend, backend and Database.
The Plan is to enable a secure website, running on a tablet in my home, where my wife and I can easly track our expenses and tag them with a fitting content.
This way, it should be easier to gain a financial overview at the end of the Month
